# Reddit-Simple-subreddit-word-cloud-generator-python
Python Jupyter notebook that prompts you for a subreddit's name, and generates a word cloud of the top 10 posts and saves word cloud to file

Uses PRAW to scrap a subreddit for text data, from the top 10 hot posts, then cleans the data using regex, stop words and lemmanizing the data. Cleaned data is then run through a basic word cloud generator and the file is saved to disk

Thank you!! :)
